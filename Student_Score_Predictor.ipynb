Here's a breakdown:\n","\n","Import Libraries:\n","\n","import pandas as pd: Imports the pandas library, commonly used for data manipulation and analysis. While imported here, it's not directly used in the file upload process itself, but likely intended for subsequent data loading from the uploaded file.\n","from google.colab import files: Imports the files module from Google Colab, which provides functions for interacting with the user's local filesystem.\n","from IPython import get_ipython: Imports a function to get the current IPython kernel instance. This is often used in notebooks but isn't directly involved in the file upload.\n","from IPython.display import display: Imports a function to display objects in a rich format in the notebook. This is not directly used in the file upload code provided.\n","Initiate File Upload:\n","\n","uploaded = files.upload(): This is the core command that triggers the file upload dialog in Google Colab. When this line is executed, a file browser will appear, allowing the user to select one or more files from their computer. The selected files are uploaded to the Colab session's temporary storage, and a dictionary containing the uploaded file names and their content as bytes is returned and assigned to the uploaded variable.\n","Iterate and Print Uploaded File Information:\n","\n","for fn in uploaded.keys():: This loop iterates through the keys of the uploaded dictionary. The keys are the names of the files that were uploaded by the user.\n","print('User uploaded file \"{name}\" with length {length} bytes'.format(name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn]))): Inside the loop, for each uploaded file, this line prints a message indicating the name of the file (fn) and the size of the file in bytes (len(uploaded[fn])).\n","In summary, this code uses the google.colab.files module to provide an interactive way for users to upload files to their Colab session and then confirms the upload by printing the names and sizes of the uploaded files."],"metadata":{"id":"kLv4nZ5fNvmV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import files\n","\n","uploaded = files.upload()\n","\n","for fn in uploaded.keys():\n","  print('User uploaded file \"{name}\" with length {length} bytes'.format(\n","      name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn])))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":90},"id":"-sG6reRFOkXU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748458178097,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10963,"user":{"displayName":"Shaik Nihal","userId":"10439242233511041689"}},"outputId":"a947ccd4-3a9d-489d-f19b-c9af6ecd9a21"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-37243df0-8da6-4569-9184-65a9f61ef98d\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-37243df0-8da6-4569-9184-65a9f61ef98d\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
